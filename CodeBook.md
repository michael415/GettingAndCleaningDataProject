# Introduction 
This repo contains my solution for the Course Project of "Getting and Cleaning Data"
which is part of the "Data Science" specialization at Coursera.

All code is in run_analysis.R and it will run all steps from downloading and unzipping
the data over processing it to saving a tidy file set in a new subfolder.

# How to use it
1. Checkout the repo
2. Switch to the newly created directory
3. Execute the script using
    - R run_analysis.R
4. You can find the resulting tidy data set in complete/tidyset.txt
